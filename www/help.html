<h4>- About this app</h4>
<p>Welcome! This application (app) was developed to query databases on several Crops Water Stress  and how it affects their yield, and Photosynthesis worldwide. Information  like these are scattered, not easy to find, often their quality is questionable and is not available online. Instead, you must download and use locally.</p>
<p>For those reasons, thanks to this application you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Check high quality data sets interactively online.</li>
  <li>    Conduct an analysis of correlation between all the variables included.</li>
  <li>    Perform a linear regression between the dependent and independent variables, according to user interest.</li>
  <li>    Plot the regression model and the results of the analysis.</li>
  <li>    Configure  a report with the information of interest, the name of user and a brief analysis, in the desired downloadable format.</li>
</ul>
<h4>- Using the app online</h4>
<p>It's very easy! Only these steps are required:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On <strong>Side Men</strong>u, please choose a data set between: <strong>Crops</strong> (% of water stress and yield of several crops); or <strong>Photosynthesis </strong>(CO2 assimilation rate and factors affecting it, by reference sources in various crops).</li>
  <li>Select  the <strong>Dependent Variable</strong> from the dropdown menu. Then, </li>
  <li>Select  the <strong>Independent Variable</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li>
  <li>See the information of your interest on <strong>Main Menu tabs</strong> (on top): 
    <ul>
      <li>Data. Shows raw data. You can specify how many rows want to see.</li>
      <li>Summary Statistics. Displays dependent and independent variables percentiles.</li>
      <li>Histograms. This tab shows selected variables' histograms. You can decide <strong>&quot;Number of bins&quot;</strong> to be displayed.</li>
      <li>Scatter Plot. Plot the relationship between variables.</li>
      <li>Correlations. The whole correlation matrix is showed.</li>
      <li>Model. Summarizes the model output.</li>
      <li>Residuals. Plots residuals and Normal Q-Q test output.</li>
      <li>Help: this window.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>- Using the app locally</h4>
<p>You can run this app on your computer doing this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install R software from <a href="Click to download">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Install and load the following libraries: googleVis, knitr and shiny.</li>
  <li>Download the whole files and folders from GitHub.</li>
  <li>Run R or RStudio. Set the folder where the files were downloaded as your working directory, and</li>
  <li>Run command &quot;runApp()&quot;.</li>
</ul>
